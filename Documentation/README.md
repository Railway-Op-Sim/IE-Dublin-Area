# Iarnród Éireann Dublin Area

A depiction of the local rail network around Dublin Connolly station in the Republic of Ireland. The layout covers much of the Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) the area between Grand Canal Dock south of Connolly and Malahide/Howth. Included is a basic early morning timetable commencing at 6am with a couple of additional freight services to and from the Alexander Road freight terminal.

This timetable does not fully complement the layout, as such I encourage others to create their own to, this would be much appreciated!
